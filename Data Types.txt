############################tuple############################
what is tuple
What is the key difference between tuples and lists?
Reverse the tuple
Access value 20 from the tuple  tuple1 = ("Orange", [10, 20, 30], (5, 15, 25))
Unpack the tuple into 4 variables tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
Swap two tuples in Python  tuple1 = (1,2),tuple2 = (3,4)
Write a program to modify the first item (22) of a list inside a following tuple to 22
   tuple1 = (11, [11, 33], 44, 55)
Sort a tuple of tuples by 2nd item
    tuple1 = (('a', 23),('b', 37),('c', 11), ('d',29))
Counts the number of occurrences of item 10 from a tuple1 = (50, 10, 60, 70, 10)
Check if all items in the tuple are the same tuple1 = (10, 10, 10, 10)
Python Program to Create a List of Tuples with the First Element as the Number and Second Element as the Square of the Number
Write a Python program to find the repeated items of a tuple
Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a list
